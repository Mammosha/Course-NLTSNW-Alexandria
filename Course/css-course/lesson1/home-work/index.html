    <h2>George Orwell - 1984</h2>
    <h3>Chapter One <span class="title-bold">Thoughtcrime</span></h3>
    <p>
        It was a bright, cold day in April and the clocks were 
        striking thirteen. <span>Whinston Smith</span> hurried home to 
        Victory Mansions with his head down to escape the terrible wind. 
        A cloud of dust blew inside with him, and the hall smelled of dust
        and yesterday's food.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the end of the hall, a poster covered one wall. 
        It showed an enormous face, more than a metre wide: 
        the face of a handsome man of about forty-five, with a large, 
        black moustache. The man's eyes seemed to follow Winston as he moved. 
        Below the face were the words 
        <span>BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING FOR YOU</span>.
    </p>
    <h3>Chapter Two <span class="title-bold">The Spies</span></h3>
    <p>
        As he opened the door, <span>Winston</span> saw that he had left 
        the diary open on the table. <span> WITH BIG BROTHER</span> 
        was written in it, in letters you could almost read across the room.
        But everything was all rigth. A small, sad-looking woman was standing outside.
