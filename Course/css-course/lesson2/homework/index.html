                &nbsp;&nbsp;Metallica is an American heavy metal band. 
                The band was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles by vocalist and guitarist James Hetfield
                 and drummer Lars Ulrich, and has been based in San Francisco for most of its career.
                 The band's fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive musicianship made them one of the
                 founding "big four" bands of thrash metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;Metallica first found commercial success with the release of its third album, 
                Master of Puppets (1986), cited as one of the heaviest metal albums and the band's
                best work. The band's next album, ...And Justice for All (1988), gave Metallica its
                first Grammy Award nomination. Metallica has released ten studio albums, four live
                albums, twelve video albums, a cover album, two extended plays, 37 singles and 39 music videos.
