    <h4>George Orwell - 1984</h4>
    <hr>
    <p><i>&nbsp;It was a bright, cold day in April and the clocks were striking thirteen. 
    Whinston Smith hurried home to Victory Mansions with his head down to escape the
    terrible wind. A cloud of dust blew inside with him, and the hall smelled of dust
    and yesterday's food.</i></p>
    <p><i>&nbsp;At the end of the hall, a poster covered one wall. It showed an enormous face, 
    more than a metre wide: the face of a handsome man of about forty-five, with a large, 
    black moustache. The man's eyes seemed to follow Winston as he moved. Below the face 
    were the words <b>BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING FOR YOU</b>.</i></p>
